# SoccerAnalytics

This repository deals with analyzing European Football matches, players and clubs data we scraped (cf. [SoccerScraping-II](doc:https://github.com/thomaSLBY/SoccerScraping-II) repository) and by means of the Transfermakrt API.

To do that, we query our PostgreSQL database with SQL and the Python library `psycopg2`.

We make basic statistics on players and clubs, like rankings, and also develop Machine Learning algorithms for more complex and more specific subjects, e.g. profiling.
